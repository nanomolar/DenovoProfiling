# DenovoProfiling
DenovoProfiling: a webserver for de novo generated molecule library profiling.

## Introduction
DenovoProfiling aim to provide a user-friendly public webserver to support the structure and chemical space visualization, scaffold analysis, molecular alignment, drugs profiling, targets and pathway profiling. We integrated cheminformatics tools and databases to provide comprehensive annotations for the de novo generated molecules. We believe that DenovoProfiling could be an efficient tool for user to capture the knowledge of de novo generated molecules quickly.
